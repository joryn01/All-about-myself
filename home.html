                <h2>My Lifestory</h2>
                <p>I grew up in a small, humble home in P-14, Brgy. Manila de Bugabus. As a child, I was known for my 
                    boundless energy, running around the neighborhood from sunrise to sunset. But with all that energy 
                    came tears. I cried at every little bump or scrape, my wails echoing through the barangay.</p>
                <p>Life was tough, with barely enough to go around, but I creativity thrived. I turned scraps into 
                    toys and simple moments into adventures. Though I didn’t have much, my hyper spirit and resilience
                     kept me going, dreaming of a brighter future.</p>

             <p>As I grew into my teenage years, my hyper energy turned into a love for traveling. I found joy in exploring
                 nearby barangays, hiking hills, and biking down dusty roads. Every trip, no matter how small, felt like an
                  adventure. Traveling gave me a sense of freedom and inspired dreams of one day exploring far-off places,
                   proving that even humble beginnings couldn’t limit a heart full of wanderlust.</p>

                <p>As a college student pursuing IT, my life became a mix of challenges and growth. Living in a boarding house,
                     I'm focused on my studies, determined to build a brighter future. Despite the demands of school, my love for
                      exploration remained. On weekends, I would visit nearby places, finding inspiration and joy in every little
                       adventure. I was turning my dreams into reality, one step at a time.</p>

                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                <p>I always enjoyed taking selfies. It wasn’t just about capturing my face it was a way for me
                     to freeze moments in time, to remember the small joys of everyday life. Whether it was a 
                    quick snap during study breaks or a fun shot with friends, selfies became my way of expressing
                    yself. Each picture told a story of my day, mood, and my journey, reminding me to appreciate
                    the little things along the way.</p>

                <p>I also loved taking mirror shots, finding them the perfect way to capture both my outfit and my vibe. 
                    Standing in front of my mirror, I’d strike a pose, adjusting my angle just right to get the perfect shot. 
                    It wasn’t just about the picture, it was about expressing myself and feeling confident in my skin. 
                    Every mirror selfie was a moment of self-expression, a reflection of my unique style and personality, 
                    and a fun way to capture my journey, one frame at a time.</p>

                <p>I cherished the moments spent playing with my dog. Whether it was a game of fetch in the yard or just 
                    running around together, those moments filled me with joy. My dog was my loyal companion, always ready 
                    to join in the fun. The fresh air, the sound of laughter, and the wagging tail made every outdoor play 
                    session special, reminding me of the simple pleasures in life and the bond he shared with his furry friend.</p>

                    <p>For me, my greatest hero wasn’t a fictional character, but my mother. She was the one who had 
                        always been there, through thick and thin. Her strength, kindness, and unwavering support inspired 
                        me every day. No matter the challenges we faced, my mother always found a way to make things work, 
                        showing me the true meaning of resilience and love. I looked up to her not just for what she did, 
                        but for the heart and spirit she carried. To me, she was the greatest hero of all.</p>

                <p>My favorite food was shrimp. Whether it was grilled, sautéed, or cooked in a savory dish, shrimp always 
                    hit the spot. The sweet, tender meat combined with just the right seasoning made every bite a treat. 
                    I loved enjoying it with a side of rice, savoring the flavors with every mouthful. Shrimp wasn’t just 
                    a meal it was a comfort, a little taste of happiness that I looked forward to after a long day.</p>

                <p>My favorite childhood friend, Shielo, had been with me through thick and thin. From playful days as kids to 
                    supporting each other in college, their friendship only grew stronger. No matter where life took them, 
                    we knew their bond would last forever.</p>
